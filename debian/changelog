  * There's no reason any more to give a complete traceback on
    SIGINT.
  * Fixed an error in the transaction logic.
  * Also rollback if the transaction is still active when we're
    handling exceptions.
  * Change the --keep option for a --delete option (so the default
    is now not to delete messages after fetching them.)
  * Print "[Fetched]" encouragingly when a message has been
    successfully delivered, for clarity for very short messages.
  * Remove the base-files dependency (which was there to ensure
    that /usr/share/common-licenses/GPL-3 was there)
  * Made the square-bracketed status messages more consistent.
  * An initial version of a script to help with making releases
