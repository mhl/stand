<h2><a name="stand">Stand - A Very Simple POP3 Client</a></h2>

version 0.96</a></h3>

<p>
This is a small Ruby script for fetching mail from POP3 servers
and delivering them to some LDA (Local Delivery Agent, typically
<a href="http://www.procmail.org/">procmail</a>,
although <a href="http://rrt.sc3d.org/">Reuben</a>
recommends <a href="http://www.courier-mta.org/maildrop/">maildrop</a>).
It does APOP authentication, SSL/TLS-wrapped POP3 and UIDL
caching.</p>

<p>
If you're using Debian, it depends on the following packages:
</p>
<ul>
<li>ruby1.9.1</li>
<li>libruby1.9.1</li>
<li>libopenssl-ruby1.9.1</li>
<li>libsqlite3-ruby1.9.1</li>
</ul>

<p>I used nothing but the original script for dealing with my
email for some years, but this is a brand new version based
largely on the work of <a href="http://rrt.sc3d.org">Reuben
Thomas</a>, who kindly took an interest in it.  As as result the
code is now less than a third of its original size.
</p>

<p>By default, stand deletes each message once it has been
successfully delivered to the LDA so use a reliable LDA (such as
procmail or maildrop) or you could easily lose mail.</p>

<p>
stand uses a YAML configuration file called
<tt>~/.stand.yaml</tt> that looks like this:
</p>

<pre>
# Comments start with `#'; leave a blank line between each
# account's details.  The Host, User and Pass lines are
# required.  Command defaults to "procmail -f-".

# For testing tpop3d:

-
  Host: localhost
  User: a@b.c
  Pass: not-my-password
  Command: procmail -f-
  APOP: yes

-
  Host: secure.mythic-beasts.com
  SSL: yes
  User: mark
  Pass: not-my-password-either
  Command: procmail -f-

-
  Host: pop.clara.net
  User: mark.longair
  Pass: something-else
  Command: procmail -f-
</pre>

<p>
The usage message (and the script itself) should tell you
anything else you need to know.
</p>

<p>Please bear in mind that it's quite possible that there may
be bugs in these scripts that will cause you to lose mail; use
this at your own risk.  You can download
the <a href="https://github.com/mhl/stand/releases/tag/version-0.96">
most recent version (currently 0.96) here</a> or from the link at
