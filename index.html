version 0.9</a></h3>

<p>
This is a small Ruby script for fetching mail from POP3 servers
and delivering them to some LDA (Local Delivery Agent, typically
<a href="http://www.procmail.org/">procmail</a>, although <a href="http://rrt.sc3d.org/">Reuben
Thomas</a>
recommends <a
href="http://www.courier-mta.org/maildrop/">maildrop</a>).  It
does APOP authentication and SSL-wrapped POP3.  I first
wrote it out of frustration with <a
href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/fetchmail/">fetchmail</a> which
has a huge number of problems with the essentially very simple
task of fetching mail from a POP3 server.
</p>

<p>
If you're using Debian, it depends on the following packages:
</p>
<ul>
<li>ruby1.8</li>
<li>libruby1.8</li>
<li>libopenssl-ruby</li>
<li>libsqlite3-ruby</li>
</ul>
<p>
If you're using the sarge versions of libruby1.8 and
libopenssl-ruby, you will have to use slightly different
versions of this script.  There is more about this below.
</p>

<p>I used nothing but the original script for dealing with my
email for some years, but this is a brand new version based
largely on the work of <a href="http://rrt.sc3d.org">Reuben</a>,
who kindly took an interest in it.  As as result the code is now
less than a third of its original size.
</p>

<!--
Some of the changes that he and I made included:
</p>

<ul>

<li>Removing the file locking code, and replacing it with calls
to programs in lockfile-progs.</li>

<li>Removing the option for writing directly to mboxes, and only
allow the piping of mail commands.</li>

<li>Removing the configuration file parsing code and making the
configuration file YAML based.
</li>

<li>Removing the UIDL caching.  This is the change I'm probably
least happy about, but since I don't use this facility any more
and Reuben and I are the only known users of this script, there
doesn't seem any point in keeping code that neither of us ever
use.  I will keep the other version on a branch, so if you're
interested in it, please email me.
</li>

<li>The behaviour is now to delete each message from the POP3
server once it has been successfully delivered to the LDA.</li>

<li>The original version used my own POP3 interface code, but
this one just uses the ruby pop module.</li>

</ul>

-->

<p>By default, stand deletes each message once it has been
successfully delivered to the LDA so use a reliable LDA (such as
procmail or maildrop) or you could easily lose mail.</p>

<p>
stand uses a YAML configuration file called
<tt>~/.stand.yaml</tt> that looks like this:
</p>

<pre>
# Comments start with `#'; leave a blank line between each
# account's details.  The Host, User and Pass lines are
# required.  Command defaults to "procmail -f-".

# For testing tpop3d:

-
  Host: localhost
  User: a@b.c
  Pass: not-my-password
  Command: procmail -f-
  APOP: yes

-
  Host: secure.mythic-beasts.com
  SSL: yes
  User: mark
  Pass: not-my-password-either
  Command: procmail -f-

-
  Host: pop.clara.net
  User: mark.longair
  Pass: something-else
  Command: procmail -f-
</pre>

<p>
The usage message (and the script itself) should tell you
anything else you need to know.
</p>

<p>Please bear in mind that it's quite possible that there may
be bugs in these scripts that will cause you to lose mail; use
this at your own risk.  You can download the most recent version
here (0.9) here: <a
href="http://repo.or.cz/w/stand.git?a=blob_plain;f=stand;hb=ee9efca0408c19f13e400fffcb9a753b016fc0af">stand</a>
or from the link at the top of the page.  If you get an
unexpected error or timeout and you have older versions of the
Ruby libraries, you should try <a
href="http://repo.or.cz/w/stand.git?a=blob_plain;f=stand;hb=6c59195b570d838ee9d2302e14541535f55fc004">this version
instead</a>.
</p>

<p>
This issue with the SSL-wrapped POP3 using the Ruby pop module
is annoying and we are planning to replace that by using
<tt>stunnel</tt> or <tt>openssl</tt>.  In addition, there's no
easy way to suppress the warning:
</p>

<pre>
/home/mark/bin/stand:46: warning: using default DH parameters.
</pre>

<p>
... that you get from libopenssl-ruby.

<p style="font-style: smaller">
For the record, my chief problems with fetchmail are below.
These may no longer be true, in which case please correct me.
</p>

<ol style="font-style: smaller">

<li>There are lots of broken POP3 servers out there, some of which I
have to use (trying to persuade ISPs to fix non-working POP3 servers
turns out to be a thankless and unproductive task.)  fetchmail doesn't
deal well with these servers.  For instance, it tries by default to use
the <tt>LAST</tt> command (which was removed in RFC1725) to work out
which messages have already been downloaded.  The problem with this is
that POP3 servers often don't implement <tt>LAST</tt> correctly; you
have to recompile fetchmail to force it to always use UIDLs instead.
Another issue is that by default it tries to use <tt>TOP 1 99999999</tt>
rather than <tt>RETR</tt> to retrieve emails.  I'm not sure where that
particular idiom came from, but my current ISP's POP3 server hangs the
connection in response to requests for huge numbers of lines with
<tt>TOP</tt>.</li>

<li>It does much more than I need it to: fetching mail from a POP3
maildrop is essentially very simple, and it doesn't take long to write a
script (like the one below) which does eveything I need from it.</li>

<li>I don't like the format of the .fetchmailrc file.  I think it's
unclear, and the `natural language' style features of the configuration
file format strike me as pointless and confusing.</li>

<li>I like to be able to have the same configuration file describing my
POP3 accounts checked out on many different shell accounts.  Then, I
want to be able to decide with a command line switch whether to leave
messages on the server or not.  fetchmail doesn't provide this facility
by default; I think the easiest way get that effect is to have two
different configuration files, one of which specifies `keep' and the
other which doesn't.  Obviously that's hardly ideal...</li>

<li>The non-SSL builds of fetchmail (e.g. the standard Debian one) don't
make it clear that they're unable to do SSL when you specify that a
server requires SSL.</li>

<li>I can see that the choice to forward retrieved mail to the local
SMTP port makes sense for fetchmail, but in the very simple situations I
want to deal with, that choice unnecessarily involves an extra (and
typically very complex) piece of software.</li>

<li>I've heard many anecdotal reports of problems with fetchmail, in
areas ranging from the daemon mode (which I gave up on quickly in any
case, because of its tendency to get stuck) to the default configuration
losing mail...  (To be fair, though, I'm not sure of the details of the
latter.)</li>

</ol>

Of course, I've played with recompiled versions of fetchmail that
address some of these issues, but I doubt my patches would be accepted
upstream.  For instance, the discussion of the <tt>LAST</tt> issue in
<tt>fetchmail(1)</tt> suggests that my patch to never use <tt>LAST</tt>
would be rejected on the grounds that <a
href="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/">ESR</a> (bizarrely) thinks it's a
Good Thing.

Of course, I could switch to a different POP3 client, such as <a
href="http://www.qcc.sk.ca/~charlesc/software/getmail-2.0/">getmail</a>
but given that (a) it's a very simple task I want the program to do and
(b) I know exactly how I want it to behave, I just went ahead and did my
own version.  This was originally called
"just-hand-over-the-mail" but Reuben made the excellent
suggestion that it should be called "stand", as in "stand and
deliver" :)
